[![build-ublue](https://github.com/lordofla/kindling/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lordofla/kindling/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A customised Fedora Kinoite image based on the [Universal Blue Kionoite-nVidia image.](https://ublue.it/)

Largely built for my machine and taking inspiration from bluefin and bluefin-dx found at the above link and potentially others in time. Feel free to use this on your own machine but note I'm not providing any kind of support for this image.

You can switch to this image with the following command: rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/lordofla/kindling:latest

This repo is forked from the [Universal Blue Starting Point repo](https://github.com/ublue-os/startingpoint) using the linked automation tool.
