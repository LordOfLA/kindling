# kindling

[![build-ublue](https://github.com/lordofla/kindling/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lordofla/kindling/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A customised Fedora Kinoite image based on the [Universal Blue Bazzite image.](https://bazzite.gg/)

Largely built for my machine and taking inspiration from bluefin and bluefin-dx found at the above link and potentially others in time. Feel free to use this on your own machine but note I'm not providing any kind of support for this image.

You can switch to this image with the following command: rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/lordofla/kindling:latest (which tracks bazzite-nvidia:stable)

This repo is forked from the [BlueBuild Template repo](https://github.com/blue-build/template)
